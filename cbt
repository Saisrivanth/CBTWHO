Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT is a practice used by psychologists to help 
people improve their mental health. CBT is known to have helped treat people with 
anxiety and depression - two very common mental health problems which are ailing 
a large portion of our society today. This video would help you understand what
 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is.

Access to Psychologists and CBT, however, can be expensive for most people.
 Most people, therefore, choose to live on with their mental health problems
  without seeking treatment.
